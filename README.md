# Enhanced Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Rays Through Model Fusion

This repository contains the implementation and supporting resources for the research project "Enhanced Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Rays Through Model Fusion." The work leverages advanced deep learning techniques, including ensemble modeling, to achieve state-of-the-art performance in pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images.

## Research Papers

The methodologies and results presented here are based on two published papers:

1. **Springer (ICCIDS 2024): [Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-Rays: A Comprehensive Review](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-69982-5_22)**
   - This paper reviews AI strategies for pneumonia detection, focusing on ensemble methods and hybrid frameworks.

2. **IEEE: [Enhanced Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Rays Through Model Fusion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704158)**
   - This paper introduces a novel ensemble model combining VGG19, InceptionV3, and Vision Transformer architectures.
